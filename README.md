# K-means-image-compressor
## How to compile
``make`` or ``make kmeansCompressor``

You need to have CUDA installed on your system to compile

## Limitations
* Currently the program only works with PNG files.
* If your PNG image is too big (say 4000 x 4000) the program may fail due to lack of memory

## TODO
Add support for other file types & deal with memory allocation for large images.
